### When I code my brain makes click! 🧠



I'm a web developer who, although I like to abstract my mind while I navigate the backend of web apps, I find myself fascinated with ReactJS ⚛️ and the whole Frontend universe. I am constantly focused on learning. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Typescript! ![imagen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dans182/Dans182/main/ts2.png)
- 🧗‍♂️ Climbing is my new hobby.
